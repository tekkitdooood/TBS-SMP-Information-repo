Welcome to the TBS SMP! The .mrpack shown here is (or should be) the most recent, up to date version of the pack!
The .mrpacks inside Outdated are only for archival purposes. It is not recommended to use them!

All kubeJS scripts are available inside their respective CLIENT or SERVER folder. 
The server section is in the server, and handles recipes. The client section only contains the item registry and assets. It is not recommended to use the server version while playing!
